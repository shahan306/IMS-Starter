# Project Title

This is my assignment from week 5, which highlights the abilities I have developed
while attending the QA Academy. It controls a MySQL database and is a Java-based
inventory management system. On database items in four separate tables, users
can carry out fundamental CRUD operations. Orders are accepted by the system,
which also generates a total price, based on the item IDs and quantities. which
later can be used or to be viewed or edited. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Softwares used to make the app and project planing application.

•Java 17 JDK
•Maven
•Git for versioning
•git hub
•jira
•SQL
•Eclipse IDE



What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system. Break down into which tests and what they do

### Unit Tests
